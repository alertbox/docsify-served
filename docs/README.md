## Features

We (`@alertbox`) run `docsify-served` locally to keep build and preview most of our GitHub Pages before publishing its content.

- Built with `node:lts-alpine` and `docsify-cli`
- No need to install NodeJS and Docsify locally
- Best for GitHub Pages, both on `master` branch and `/doc` folder
- Supports `private`, `internal`, and `public` repos
- Maintained by [the Alertbox Docker Team](https://github.com/alertbox/whale-docsify-served/)
- Powered by [Docsify](https://docsify.js.org/) and [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)
